# Introduction 
This is a Visual Studio Code extension which add English words whitespace among Chinese words in full text. This project based on project [vscode-pangu](https://github.com/halfcrazy/vscode-pangu). Thanks for the author!

# Why I open this project
The origin extension pangu is hard to use, so I decided to make it easier.

# Getting Started
Click the right mouse button -> Space English Words, Bingo!

# Build and Test
1. Execute command `npm install` in the project root folder, then F5 is all your need.
2. Somethimes you may need `npm install @types/pangu`.
